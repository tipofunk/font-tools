%%Source: Adobe
%%Release: 2015-11-18

%
% Total number of glyphs: 253
%      205 precomposed + 48 that could be done with mark attachment
%      (the 48 have no pre-composed forms in Unicode)
%
% This version of the data uses pre-composed forms for those 48 glyphs, 
% instead of relying on mark/mkmk for dynamic composition of those glyphs.
% Probably you would use 'ccmp' to access these newly-composed glyphs.

%
